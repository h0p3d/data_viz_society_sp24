			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

		<h3>Starting Question</h3>
		"How have population numbers and age demographics in the US changed between 1900 and 2000?"
		<br><br>
		From looking at the numbers and knowing a bit about US history, I
		anticipated that the data would show both that the US population grew
		significantly between 1900 and 2000 and that the median life
		expectancy increased significantly due to lowering infant mortality rates
		and longer-average life expectancies due to advancements in medical
		technology among other things. I wanted this visualization to tell
		that story in a way that humanized or emphasized this dramatic change,
		but I was torn between whether to focus on one or both narratives.
		<br><br>
		I chose to ignore the gendered aspect of the data because I do not
		think that gender is a relevant part of this narrative.
		Also, there are problems inherent to treating
		gender like a binary classification instead of as a complex biological,
		social, and psychological multi-dimensional spectrum. However, age
		also has a lot of complex biological, social, and ethical meanings
		(ie., how people physically mature at different
		rates and experience different biological stages of life at different
		ages, when is a person considered a child vs. an adult,
		does life begin at birth, etc.)

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The idea for this visualization came from the similar graphic
					we saw about income and college attendance rates in lecture
					on Monday. I liked the idea of making the data more memorable
					by having people draw out their guess before getting the answer.
					The thick black line was my actual guess, I was surprised that
					the actual numbers for the 2000 census dipped and then increased, but this makes
					sense due to the baby boomer generation. I think the
					surprise factor is nice, but I think I also agree that because
					people don't expect visualizations to be interactive / may
					not want to put in the effort to explore the visualization
					that presenting the information up front or in a more "scrolly-telling"
					style might be more effective.
				</li>
				<li>Showing the y-axis in terms of millions instead of thousands
					of thousands as shown in the raw data made the scale more
					easily interpretable in my opinion.
				</li>
				<li>Note I made this sketch before I saw the phase 2 restriction that the
					visualiation had to be static.
				</li>
				<li>Another limitation is that this is showing the data as if it were
					continuous when it is really discrete. A bar chart might show
					this more transparently.
				</li>
				<li>The colors for this chart don't really come through (I
					only had a four color pen), but I wanted the other guesses
					to be grey, your guess to be black, and the actual numbers
					to be in a thick blue line. I think using different neutral
					colors to distinguish the different data points will help
					highlight the different sources to the user.
				</li>
				<li>
					After showing this prototype to someone with no context for
					the assignment, the person suggested moving the instructions
					from a tooltip to above the graphic, moving the legend to
					the left hand side or the bottom, and commented that they
					mainly got how close the guess was to the actual from the
					visualization, and didn't understand why the 1900 data was
					present. So intent was not achieved.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>

				groups in 1900 and 2000. Instead of a typical bar chart, I sought
				to humanize the data by (poorly) drawing figures that appeared
				as different aged people.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I wanted to create a more memorable visualization without
					requiring as much effort from the user. The conversations
					about chart junk
					in lecture made me wonder if adding embellishment like
					having babies represent the height of the bar chart for
					age 0, children for age 5, 10, 15,
					adults for 20-50, and an elderly person for 50+ might
					emphasize the human effect that decreasing infant mortality
					and increasing life expectancy had. I even thought it might
					be cool to embellish the figures to have period dress or be
					more diverse in terms of hairstyle, gender, and race, or to
					dress like the decade that group of people was born in but
					I think that might be more distracting and complicated.
				</li>
				<li>The title "A Snapshot of US Population by age 1900 vs 2000" was
					supposed to evoke emotion of looking at two pictures in the
					same place side by side a hundred years apart.
				</li>
				<li>Adding the decade each cohort was born in was also meant as
					a neat reverse timeline. I think it both acts as an explainer
					(the bump in the middle due to the baby boomer generation
					becomes instantly recognizable by the year) and as a
					humanizing effect (you start to wonder wow
					someone who was 40 in 1900 was born during the US Civil War,
					I wonder what that was like) and it makes the history element
					more tangible (like wow many people in 1900 still
					remembered what it was like to live in a US where it was
					legal to own people.)
				</li>
				<li>I think the limitation here is that showing the raw numbers
					draws your attention to the numbers and the population
					growth and the history while perhaps de-emphasizing the
					other narrative of decreasing infant mortality and
					increased longevity. Another change I might make in hindsight
					is flipping the x and y axis so that the people are side-by-side,
					not standing on top of each other.
				</li>
				<li>After showing this prototype to someone with no context for
					the assignment: the person was confused by the description
					on the left (I accidentally flipped the colors on this chart)
					and didn't really get that the data was coming from different
					censuses based on the phrasing. The presence of both decades
					and age was similarly confusing, and they recommended I go
					with one or the other (I'm thinking maybe some annotations
					might make this more clear because including decade of
					people born in x decade alive in y census year is a bit
					confusing.)
				 </li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="prototype3.jpg" width="70%" alt="Third Prototype sketch" />
				<figcaption>
				This is a cleaner and simpler bar chart that is attempting to
				focus on presenting the change in age demographics by displaying
				percentage instead of population numbers.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Sorry for the bad bar chart drawing! With this prototype I
					wanted to explore what would happen if I tried to take the
					change in population numbers out of the equation so the
					viewer could compare the age distributions more easily.
					I think this primarily has the effect of de-emphasizing
					the population numbers (less transparency?) while also making
					the difference in age distribution clearer.
				</li>
				<li>After showing this prototype to someone with no context for
					the assignment, the person initially thought it was showing
					numbers not percentages (but they had also seen the previous
					two prototypes first so may have been primed to look for
					numbers), and didn't get the main observation I was trying
					to convey of changing infant mortality / life expectancy. </li>
				<li>I think this chart would be better with 10 bins instead of
					20, with the bar charts overlapping to allow for better direct
					comparison, and with annotations at the key points indicating
					change in infant mortality, median life expectancy, and
					percent of population above 60.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        I know this wasn't part of the assignment per se, but I think my main
		reflection is on the stark contrast between my intent for each prototype
		visualization and the actual confusion / other feedback that a
		non-technical user had. I think partly this is due to the rough nature
		of prototype sketches that the eye immediately jumps to what is unclear
		or what is not designed well instead of the data itself. But also, I
		realized that in my first couple of prototypes I was trying to communicate
		a lot of information and that without the additional context of annotations
		or explanatory text that the message I was trying to convey was lost.
		While the first couple of prototypes may have been more "creative", I think
		I will ultimately make something closer to the third prototype even
		though it is a bit "boring" and narrower in scope because
		I think that with simplicity there comes a clarity of information that.
		Before this, I did not fully appreciate that there is something worse than
		a visualization that fails to communicate in a memorable or impactful
		way- it's a visualization that fails to communicate at all.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
			When I initially looked at the data on Monday, I had no idea how I
			was going to approach this assignment. After all, US Census data seems
			<i>so boring</i>. However, I think the lectures the past couple of
			weeks on chart annotations, storytelling, affect, and creative
			interactions helped me frame my design choices around a story or message
			I wanted to convey. In the previous data exploration assignment,
			I tried to discover a story in the data and explore how
			the readings did or did not apply to Boston specific data. This
			assignment, because I drew the prototypes before deeply analyzing
			the data, I had to start with a story in mind about population
			growth and life expectancy improvements, which led me to think and
			experiment with various techniques that I had seen in lecture or
			articles that could convey this story and make it memorable.

      		</p>
			<p>
			Ultimately, I decided to answer a question about the difference in
			age demographics in the US in 1900 and 2000. I chose to use a bar
			chart because the data had discrete values. I originally had 10
			bars instead of 20, but I discovered that the child mortality and
			aging population statistics I wanted to use fell at 5 years and 65 years
			so I split the data back into 20 bins, even though this made the
			x-axis labels a bit tight and cluttered. The 5 year bins also provide a more
			detailed view of the varying curve of the 2000 data and the normal
			distribution shape of the 1900 data. In terms of color, I used orange
			for 1900 as a sort of "warning color" because of the high infant
			mortality and lower life expectancy, and blue for 2000 provided a
			clear contrast. In terms of axes, I wanted to provide clear and easy
			to read interpretations of the data, hence the color legend at the
			top, the brief y-axis description, and age bins clearly defined so
			their values are clear. Because the x axis was so cluttered, I added
			the icons to make it easy to see at a glance what it was trying to
			convey. Finally, in order to make sure my message / story was clearly
			conveyed, I flagged points of interest I wanted the viewer to
			notice with annotations that looked like flags so that the viewer
			could interpret the chart within the relevant context I was aiming
			for.

			</p>


      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
		Phase one definitely narrowed my scope for this assignment and allowed
		me to focus my designs towards conveying a specific message. I felt like
		being primed with examples of engaging visualizations in class and
		thinking of what my prototypes could look like in the back of my mind
		for a few days before I even drew them really helped my creative
		process, and I definitely agree that drawing it on paper helped me avoid
		being confined in terms of technological limitations / default design
		choices. Doing the informal user feedback session on my sketches allowed
		me to iterate quickly and focus on prototype 3, as I realized that
		trying to convey both growth and demographics might overcomplicate
		the narrative. The feedback session also confirmed the need for annotations
		to clearly convey my narrative, as it became clear that raw numbers
		have many interpretations and not everyone immediately jumps to the
		historical context of the data. I also added the pictoral elements of
		prototype 2 to humanize the data a bit. While I was interested in the
		Baby Boomer bump, I ultimately left out the population growth
		narrative I explored in prototype 1 and 2 to avoid cluttering the
		visualization with too many annotations.
	  </p>


	<h3>Meta-Reflection</h3>
	<p>
        I think the past two assignments have been valuable practical learning
		opportunities, but they feel like two incomplete halves of a larger
		data visualization design process that I'm starting to get a feel for.
		I want to start with data exploration, and once I understand the data
		create a story around it, create visualizations that convey that story
		and then iterate on those designs based on user feedback. However,
		implementing the exploration and story building (and seeking my own user feedback)
		separately helped me understand why it's not as satisfying to have
		one without the other. I'm afraid that in this assignment, because I was
		so pre-occupied with my pre-conceived narrative, that I lost out on
		other insights or other stories the data could have told. It would be
		interesting to see how my peers interpreted the same data.
