				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I chose to display the raw number of reports per year.
					The numbers are increasing likely because not as many 2020 active police officers
					were working in the early 2000s, which is highly deceptive (-2).
					Even if the caption mentions active police officers, and
					cites the source of the data, displaying the data by year
				    is still highly deceptive because most readers won't investigate further.
				</li>
				<li>I chose to display the reports by race in
					decreasing order and included many categories (while not
					including null, other, refused, and Native American),
					included different types of allegations, attempted to use
					a neutral color scheme and stretched the
					x-axis to make it seem like my intent was informative
					rather than persuasive. (-1)
				</li>
				<li>I obscured the outcome of the complaints and used terms
					like reports and misconduct in the titles to imply that
				    allegations had been substantiated. While I think filing
					a complaint is somewhat synonymous with filing a report in
					some contexts, it is still misleading (-1).

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					In this case, focusing on the number of unvalidated reports
					per year is highly deceptive, as it makes it seem like the
					number of false reprts has dramatically increased since the
					early 2000s. Separating the three possible outcomes (exonerated,
					unsubstantiated, and substantiated) into two binary categories
					and omitting how many unsubstantiated complaints are caused
					by lack of police cooperation is highly deceptive (-2)
				</li>
				<li>I left out annotations because I wanted to persuade the reader
					by letting them make the observations on their own that while
					white officers had far more allegations, they were more likely
					to be found innocent compared to black officers (while
					ommitting mentions of racism at play in both the allegations
					 and their outcomes) is deceptive. (-1)
				</li>
				<li>Again, I used a neutral color palette and a variety of chart
					types to attempt to obscure the persuasive intent of the graphics (-1).

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>Creating deceptive visualizations was far harder than I thought it would be.
		I went through several iterations of graphics, starting with very clearly
		one-sided visuals that I attempted to tone down by playing with the
		colors, axes and removing the annotations (see early prototypes below).
<br><br>
		I was surprised that both including and ommitting complaint outcome data
		felt deceptive because of the bias within the data itself. According
		to the ProPublica description, reports
		were often unsubstantiated because of police departments were unwilling
		to provide evidence such as body cam footage. Additionally, current
		laws give police broad discretion, especially as it applies to use of force
		which contributes towards why so few incidents are substantiated.
		Finally, I knew the data was biased towards increasing numbers of
		reports over time because it only included active police officers in
		2020. Because data was not available for all reports over the
		time period, such as reports that led to police resigning, quitting, or
		being tried for crimes which would make them not active, the entire
		framing of the proposition itself was biased. Without the full context
		for the data it is hard to imagine readers being able to detect all
		forms of deception. It is also quite easy to imagine visual designers
		unintentionally creating deceptive visualizations by
		failing to account for all possible forms of bias within the data.
<br><br>
		Given that I cannot erase the bias from incomplete data that is collected
		within the historically (and current) racist context of policing, I don't think it's possible
		to create a purely neutral visualization. Certainly more ethical choices
		could be made that convey the limitations of the data more transparently.
		Perhaps clearly communicating the intent of the visualization as
		shown below could in some ways make the bias more transparent, although
		this likely makes the visualizations far less persuasive.
